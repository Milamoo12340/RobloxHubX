🌐 GEOLOCATION DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS:
==================================================
❗ CRITICAL FINDING: Geographic IP Mismatch Detected
- COMPROMISE LOCATION: Zagreb, Croatia (45.8150° N, 15.9819° E)
- CDN SERVER LOCATIONS: United States (Cloudflare network)
- VICTIM'S NORMAL LOCATION: [Original location - NOT Croatia]

EXPLANATION OF DISCREPANCY:
The CDN (Content Delivery Network) servers showing USA locations are NORMAL Roblox infrastructure.
The SUSPICIOUS activity is the login from Zagreb, Croatia, which does not match:
1. Victim's normal geographic location

This confirms UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS from a foreign location.
