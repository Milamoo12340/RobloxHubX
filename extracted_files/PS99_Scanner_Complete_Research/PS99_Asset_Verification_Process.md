# Asset Verification Process
To ensure we're only displaying legitimate PS99 leaks, we will implement this verification process:

1. **Source Verification**: Asset must come from confirmed BIG Games developer or group
2. **Date Verification**: Asset must be newly created/uploaded (within past week)
3. **Keyword Matching**: Asset name or description must match PS99 related keywords
4. **Metadata Capture**: Must save developer name, upload date, and asset ID
5. **Image Verification**: Must download and verify the actual image/asset
6. **Context Check**: Check if asset fits with PS99 style/theme

Each leak report will include:
- Asset name
- Asset ID with direct link
- Developer name who created it
- Creation date
- Preview image
- Source verification method
