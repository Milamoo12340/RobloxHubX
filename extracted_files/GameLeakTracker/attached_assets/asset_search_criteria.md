# Asset Search Criteria for Verified Developers

When scanning for new assets from verified BIG Games developers, we should follow these criteria:

1. **Only scan for assets created within the last 7 days**
   - This focuses on recent uploads that may be for upcoming updates

2. **Only add new assets to our database**
   - Don't re-add assets we've already discovered
   - Compare against existing asset database

3. **Check specific asset locations:**
   - Developer's inventory for newly added items
   - Developer's "Creations" tab
   - Developer's "Places" for testing areas
   - Groups owned by the developer

4. **Filter assets by keywords:**
   - Primary: Anubis, Egypt, Pyramid, Pharaoh, Desert, Sarcophagus, Mummy, Sphinx
   - Secondary: Ancient, Egyptian, Tomb, Treasure, Gold, Scarab, Ankh
   - General PS99: Sim, Pet, Hatch, Egg, Update55, Gem, Coins

5. **Verify asset authenticity:**
   - Confirm asset was actually created by the developer
   - Check that asset style matches Pet Simulator 99
   - Verify creation date is recent
